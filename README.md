First, install VimPlug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Next, go into .vimrc and run :PlugInstall.

(For VimTex, make sure you have a compatible PDF viewer for autocompile updates from VimTex, and edit those .vimrc options accordingly.)

Then, move the tex.snippets file to the ~/.vim/Ultisnips/ folder.
